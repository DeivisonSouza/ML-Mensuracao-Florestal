.content-box-blue[**Motivos práticos para fazer uma análise de regressão...**] &lt;br&gt;

- **Determinação**: Variáveis difíceis de determinar em campo;
  - ex.: volume, biomassa, altura, etc.
- **Alto custo**: Almeja-se diminuir custos!
- **Larga escala**: Imagine fazer isso em larga escala! É impraticável!
- **Alternativa**: Usar métodos indiretos.

**Regressão Linear**: Método mais tradicional!

`\(v = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}(d^2h) + \epsilon_i\)` `\(\Rightarrow\)` **Spurr (1952)**

`\(ln (v) = ln\beta_0 + \beta_{1}ln(d) + \beta_{2}ln(h) + \epsilon_i\)` `\(\Rightarrow\)` **Schumacher-Hall (1933)**

- **Inferencial**: Tirar conclusões sobre a população:
  - Interpretar parâmetros;
  - Estimar os intervalos de confiança (IC) dos parâmetros; e
  - Testes de hipóteses (normalidade, homocedasticidade dos resíduos, etc.) `\(\Rightarrow\)` .content-box-red[Suposições da RL]

*Por exemplo:* Admitindo o modelo `\(v = \beta_0 + \beta_1d + \epsilon_i\)` (**Berkhout**)

Qual a relação entre `\(v\)` e o `\(d\)`?

Qual efeito no volume para uma unidade de mudança no diâmetro da árvore?

- **Preditivista**: Estimar uma função de regressão `\(f(x)\)` com bom poder preditivo! .content-box-red[O foco é na predição!]

# Aprendizado de Máquina (*Machine Learning*)

**História:**
- Surgiu em 1959;
- Arthur Lee Samuel: Cunhou pela primeira vez o termo *Machine Learning*; e
- Manuscrito: .blue[*Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers*] &lt;a id='cite-samuel1959some'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.33.0210'&gt;Samuel, 1959&lt;/a&gt;).

**Definição:** &lt;br&gt;
É um .content-box-red[subconjunto de inteligência artificial] que frequentemente usa técnicas estatísticas para dar aos computadores a capacidade de .content-box-red["aprender"] com dados, sem serem explicitamente programados. &lt;br&gt;

# A idéia de "Supervisionar"...

.blockquote[
**Em um conjunto de dados...** &lt;br&gt;

(..) para cada observação de preditora(s), `\(x_{i}\)` (i = 1, ..., n), existe uma resposta associada `\(y_{i}\)` (James, et al., 2013).

**O papel de Supervisor...** &lt;br&gt;
A idéia é que cada `\(y_{i}\)` exerça um papel de .content-box-red[“Professor”], responsável por .content-box-red[“Supervisionar”] o processo de aprendizagem de uma
função `\(f(x)\)` (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, 2016).
